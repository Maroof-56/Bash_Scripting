    1. Provide path to directory.
    2. Check if the directory is present or not.
    3. Create 'archive' folder if not already present.
    5. Find all files with size more than your_assumption.
    6. Compress each file.
    7. Move the comressed file in 'archive' folder.
    8. Make a cron job to run the  script at given time.


  Make Sure you breakdown the script each steps to simplify , execute each steps & move ahead.
